# Production
The goal of this project is to create a software for a media player production facility that will make the jobs of the workers more efficient. We are working to automate
the process by allowing the workers to input the items and the software stores the information into a database along with a list of the items that are able to be produced
by the facility. I made this project independently in my Object Oriented Programming class in the Fall 2020 semester at Florida Gulf Coast University. I created this 
project in my dorm room while taking all of my classes online.
